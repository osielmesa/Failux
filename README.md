# Failux

Failux is a simplified and broken implementation of Redux.
In the sandbox you'll find a small application written in Failux
and React.

This is not working: stopwatch where you can change the update
interval.

When you click on "start", the stopwatch should start and after
a specified update interval increases its value by the value of
the interval.

When you click on "stop", the stopwatch must stop and reset its
value. 

Fork sandbox and fix issues as well as potentially
problematic code. Make code modern and more readable. 
Comment your solution.
